# Stunting_Classification_Project
This was my Machine Learning Classification Project that i did when i was Internshiping in BAPPEDA Kota Yogyakarta. 

## Project Title: Stunting Classification for Yogyakarta City Study Case in BAPPEDA Kota Yogyakarta

**Purpose:**
This project employs the SVM algorithm for classification, utilizing oversampling and hyperparameter tuning to precisely classify stunting rates in various regions (kemantren) within Yogyakarta city.

**Attributes:**
Drawing on a dataset with 20 carefully chosen attributes, the model provides a nuanced understanding of stunting prevalence in different areas.

**Algorithm and Methods:**
Utilizing the SVM algorithm, this project employs a classification approach, incorporating oversampling techniques and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and performance.

**Results:**
Impressively, the model achieved a remarkable 97% accuracy, establishing its efficacy in discerning and classifying stunting rates across diverse regions within Yogyakarta city.
